# Quick start

Install the `comby-reducer` binary on your path with
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm):

```
npm install -g @comby-tools/comby-reducer
```

Invoke it like this:

```
comby-reducer <file-to-reduce> --transforms ./transforms -- <crashing-program> @@
```

To feed the file input to `<crasing-=program>` via `stdin`, invoke it like this instead:

```
comby-reducer <file-to-reduce> --stdin --transforms ./transforms -- <crashing-program>
```

## Alternative local install

Install `comby-reducer` in a local directory at
`./node_modules/.bin/comby-reducer`. If you see some warnings just ignore them.

```
npm install @comby-tools/comby-reducer
```

## Example

Let's say you just ran a program that crashed a compiler and want to find a
smaller example program that triggers the same crash. We'll simulate how to
find a smaller example program with `comby-reducer`.

**Step 1.** Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/comby-tools/comby-reducer
```

In [`example/program.c`](./example/program.c) you'll find the program we'll reduce:

```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<string.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  if (argv[1]) {
      printf("I can't believe it's not butter");
  }
  // But I want to believe it's not butter...
  memset(NULL, 1, 1);
}
```

The `memset` statement causes a crash when we run this program. There's some
junk in there that we don't need to trigger the crash. Let's get started.

**Step 2.** Go into the `example` directory

```
cd example
```

Next, we'll use a "pretend compiler" that crashes when it "compiles" our
program (in reality, our "compiler" crashes when it runs a valid C program, not
when actually compiling it, but we'll suspend our greater knowledge for now).

**Step 3**: Run this command to crash the compiler

```bash
./compiler.sh program.c
```

You'll see something like this at the end: `./compiler.sh: line 7: 41936 Segmentation fault: 11  ./program`

**Step 4**: Reduce the program

```bash
comby-reducer program.c --file /tmp/in.c --lang .c --transforms ../transforms -- ./compiler.sh @@
```

You should see:

```
[+] Loaded 22 transformation rules
[+] Did pass 0 pass
[+] Did pass 1 pass
[+] Did pass 2 pass
[+] Did pass 3 pass
[+] Result:
#include<string.h>
void main() {
  memset(NULL, 1, 1);
}
```

Nice, our program is smaller! `comby-reduce` found  that a smaller valid
program keeps crashing our "compiler", but without the cruft.

Let's break down the command invocation:

- The part after `--` is the command we want to run that causes a crash. In our case, `./compiler.sh @@`
  - The `@@` part is substituted with a file containing a program (like `program.c`)
  - To feed input from `stdin`, remove the `@@` and add the `--stdin` command line flag.

- `--file /tmp/in.c` says that the `@@` we substitute should be named `/tmp/in.c`. The `.c` extension may matter if our compiler expects a file with a `.c` extesion, for example. `comby-reducer` will try borrow the extension of the original file but `--file` exists to give you control over the file name that your program sees.

- `--lang .c` says that the language we want to reduce is C-like. `comby-reducer` uses language definitions to parse input according to some language. This matters so that our transforms can accurately match strictly code blocks and avoids bothering with not-actually-code-syntax that come up in comments and strings. This may not be a big deal. You can use `--lang .generic` if you have some DSL or smart contract language. Here's the list of [specific language parsers](https://comby.dev/docs/overview#does-it-work-on-my-language).

- `--transforms <dir>` loads transform definitions from `.toml` files in the specified `dir` (default dir is `transforms`). Transforms are specified in a [TOML format](https://comby.dev/docs/configuration#toml-format) using [`comby` syntax](https://comby.dev/docs/syntax-reference). See [Usage](#Usage) below for more details.

## Usage

### Transformations

`comby-reducer` makes it easy to write rules for transformation using [comby syntax](https://comby.dev/docs/syntax-reference).
A handful of defaults are included in
[`transforms/config.toml`](transforms/config.toml) that will probably get you
very far already. Here are some examples.

```toml
[empty_paren]
match='(:[1])'
rewrite='()'
rule='where nested'
```

This transform matches any content between balanced parentheses (including
newlines) and deletes the content. The `:[1]` is a variable that can be used in
the rewrite part. By default, `comby-reducer` will try to apply this
transformation at the top-level of a file, wherever it sees `(...)`. The
`rule='where nested'` tells `comby-reducer` that it should also attempt to
reduce nested matches of `(...)` inside other matched `(...)`. In general,
parentheses are a common syntax to nest expressions in programs, so it makes
sense to add `rule='where nested'`.

Another transform preserves the first comma-separated element inside
parentheses:

```toml
[preserve_first_paren_element]
match='(:[1],:[2])'
rewrite='(:[1])'
```

Program syntax often use call or function-like syntax that comma-separate
parameters or arguments inside parenthes. This transformation attempts to remove
elements in such syntax. This transform doesn't have a `rule` part, since it
might not be as fruitful to attempt nested reductions inside of `:[1]` or
`:[2]`. But, we could easily add it.

A last example uses a special form `:[var:e]` which matches "expression-like"
syntax.

```toml
[remove_first_expression_for_colon_sep_space]
match=':[1:e], :[2:e]'
rewrite=':[2]'
```

Expression-like syntax matches contiguous non-whitespace characters like `foo`
or `foo.bar`, as well as contiguous character sequences that include valid code
block structures like balanced parentheses in `function(foo, bar)` (notice how
whitespace is allowed inside the parentheses). The transform above will attempt
to remove expression-like syntax between commas, which often separate
expressions inside objects, records, or lists.

**More info.** You can learn more about the underlying matching engine at
[comby.dev](https://comby.dev/docs/basic-usage). You can try out
transformations on [comby.live](bit.ly/3lOmS4W) to check that a transformation
behaves the way you want it to.

**Limitations and known issues.** 

- Although regular expression matching is possible with `:[...]` syntax in
  [`comby`](https:/github.com/comby-tools/comby), it's **not yet possible to
  write regular expression holes in `comby-reducer` transforms.**

- Some inputs may trigger a stack overflow in `node`. Post a GH issue with the
  input if you run into this.

### Tips

#### Customize crash criteria with scripts

`comby-reducer` expects a program to exit with signal `139` or `134` to consider
it a crash. Many programs that crash won't exit with these values, however. For
example, the [Solidity compiler](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity) exits
with a signal `1`. Even more challenging, the exit signal `1` may mean that the
program crashes, or that the program doesn't compile (and we want the program to
still compile). The exit signal `1` is not a reliable way to know that the
program crashed "for real". What to do?

It'll depend on your program, but you generally want to define some criteria that
constitutes a valid crash, and wrap that logic in a script. For Solidity, a valid program
that crashes the compiler will emit something like:

```
Internal compiler error during compilation:
/solidity/libsolidity/ast/Types.h(797): Throw in function virtual std::unique_ptr<ReferenceType>
```

We can use this information in a script, and exit with the expected crash code
to signal a crash. Here's one I used before, called `compile.sh`, that will exit the script with
signal `139` when it sees the `Internal compiler error` message:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

RESULT=$(~/solidity/build/solc/solc $1 2>&1)
MATCH=$(echo $RESULT | grep -c "Internal compiler error")
if [ $MATCH == 0 ]; then
        exit 0 # no match, program doesn't cause expected crash
fi

exit 139
```

You can get very fancy with your script, and can use it further refine program
reduction. For more inspiration read up on [interestingness tests](https://embed.cs.utah.edu/creduce/using/) covered by
[C-reduce](https://github.com/csmith-project/creduce).

#### Output

Output the final reduced program by piping the `comby-reducer` command to a
file. The final program is sent to `stdout`, the informative messages are
printed to `stderr`.

### Options

Some additional command line flags:

`--record` is an optional flag that emits the program at each step of a
successful reduction, in the form `<num>.step`, in the current directory. You
can replay the transformations by running `comby-reducer-replay` in the current
directory. See more on [comby-reducer-replay](#comby-reducer-replay) below.

`--lang <extension>` is a flag that determines how the source file is
  parsed. Using an extension like `.c` or `.go` will make `comby-reducer` parse
  the input according to that language.

`--transforms <dir>` will use `.toml` transform definitions in the specified `dir`.

`--debug` will emit the reduced program after each step, and the transformation that succeeded to `stderr`.

## comby-reducer-replay

`comby-reducer-replay` is the answer to "How was my program reduced?".
`comby-reducer-replay` is installed along with `comby-reducer` and should be
available based on how you installed it.

After running `comby-reducer` with `--record`, simply run `comby-reducer-replay`
in the current directory, and step through the transformed program at each step
(left and right arrow keys). Try running `comby-reducer-replay` inside
[replay-example](./replay-example) to step through a recording of a previous
crash reduction for a Solidity compiler bug.

By default replays will use `git diff` to render changes. To override the
default, a custom diff command can be entered on the command-line like this:

```bash
comby-reducer-replay colordiff -y
```

where `colordiff -y` shows a side-by-side colored diff of changes. Underneath
the hood, the `.step` files will be appended to the command, like `colordiff -y
000.step 001.step`

Some sensible default flags are included for common diff tools, which you can
explore by entering only the name of the tool and no other extra command line
flags:

```bash
comby-reducer-replay git               # the default
comby-reducer-replay patdiff           # an enhanced patience diff tool
comby-reducer-replay colordiff         # colordiff, configured to render side-by-side
comby-reducer-replay diff              # plain old diff, configured to render side-by-side
```

I recommend installing [`patdiff`](https://github.com/janestreet/patdiff) for
an enhanced viewing experience. `patdiff` simply understands diffs a bit
better. To get `patdiff`, you'll have to:

- [Install opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html) with

  `sh <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocaml/opam/master/shell/install.sh)`

- Run `eval $(opam env)`
- Run `opam install patdiff`

And `patdiff` should now be available on your path.

## Development

- Install `npm`.
- Install `npx`.

```
npm i typescript @types/node minimist @types/minimist @iarna/toml @types/iarna__toml
npx tsc
```
